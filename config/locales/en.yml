      title: About
      p1: "RGovData is a ruby library for really simple access to government data.
        It aims to make consuming government data sets a \"one liner\",
        letting you focus on what you are trying to achieve with the data, and happily
        ignore all the messy underlying details of transport protocols, authentication and so on."
      note1: "RGovData can be used as a command line tool, a library for ruby projects,
        or a library for rails projects."
      oneline:
        title: One line.. srsly?
        p1: "Yes! For example, this gets the number of worldwide M1+ Earthquakes
          in the past 7 Days (from a CSV source):"
        p2: "Or perhaps, how do I access a complete list of
          Libraries in Singapore? (this pulls from an OData web service):"

        title: Contributing to RGovData
        p1: "As you can see from the \"Live Examples\", RGovData works;-) But there's a
          whole shopping list of things that it could do better. In particular, the project
          is looking for collaborators from around the world to help adapt it to
          their own government data sources. See the GitHub project page for more information."

        title: Data Encumberance
        p1: "Although it's all theoretically \"our government data\", be aware that many of the
          data sets you can get with RGovData may be encumbered by copyright, commercial or
          other terms of use."
        p2: "It is up to *you* to ensure that your use of data complies with all the applicable
          restrictions. RGovData simply provides a mechanism for getting the data, and explicitly
          does not provide any rights enforcement or protection."
